# Project - Food Desert Severity by County in the United States
This is a Javascript/Python project that aims to show a county by county breakdown and choropleth
map of the United States that shows the relaative percentage of the population that lives in a food desert.
It also shows plots comparing the percentage of population that lives in a food desert to the median income
and the percent of the population that is considered a minority.

The app is hosted on heroku and can be found at the below link.\n
